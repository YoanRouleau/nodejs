# Node.js Exercise 1 – Getting Started


## Clone the Remote Repository

This will copy some ``nodejs`` program files to your ``htdocs`` folder.

1.	Type these commands into your *Git Bash* client:

	```
	$ cd /<DRIVE>/xampp/htdocs   
	$ git clone https://github.com/noucampdotorgSSAD2020/nodejs.git nodejs
	$ cd nodejs
	$ dir 

	```

Check your ``htdocs`` folder.  You should have a new folder called ``nodejs`` with some files in it.



## Part 1 – Hello NodeJS

1.	Run the ``HelloWorld.js`` node program

    ```
	$ cd /<DRIVE>/xampp/htdocs/nodejs
	$ node HelloWorld.js

	```

1.	Examine and run the following programs too:

    - ``sync.js``
    - ``async.js``
    - ``async2.js``
